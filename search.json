    "text": "The data utilized in this project originates from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), specifically the “Emissions from Production & Transformation Processes by Chemical” records as published in 2023 EPA. This dataset comprises facility-reported, chemical-level emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases within the electronics manufacturing sector, including key variables such as chemical name, facility identifier, reporting year, and total annual emissions measured in metric tons. To ensure analytical rigor, we performed thorough data cleaning, excluding any entries with missing chemical names or emission values and standardizing categorical fields for modeling purposes. All variable names were harmonized and formatted for clarity and consistency in downstream statistical analysis. The resulting clean dataset serves as the foundation for both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, enabling a detailed investigation into the factors that drive greenhouse gas emissions at the chemical and facility level within the electronics industry."

    "text": "In the era of swift technological progress, the environmental impacts of electronics production have become increasingly significant. This research provides a comprehensive, data-driven examination of greenhouse gas emissions at the molecular level inside the electronics manufacturing sector. I performed a systematic analysis of individual fluorinated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across diverse chemicals, sites, and years utilizing facility-reported data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The analysis identified the predominant chemical species and highlighted significant facility-level and temporal trends in the industry by focusing on reported emissions in metric tons. A limited number of chemicals contribute disproportionately to total emissions, as indicated by exploratory data analysis, whereas annual patterns reveal variability associated with facility operations and manufacturing cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Chemical Emissions by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Chemical Emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE: 17.36499 \n\n\n\n\n\nActual vs Predicted Emissions"
