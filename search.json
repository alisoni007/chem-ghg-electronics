    "text": "The data utilized in this project originates from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), specifically the “Emissions from Production & Transformation Processes by Chemical” records as published in 2023 EPA. This dataset comprises facility-reported, chemical-level emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases within the electronics manufacturing sector, including key variables such as chemical name, facility identifier, reporting year, and total annual emissions measured in metric tons. To ensure analytical rigor, we performed thorough data cleaning, excluding any entries with missing chemical names or emission values and standardizing categorical fields for modeling purposes. All variable names were harmonized and formatted for clarity and consistency in downstream statistical analysis. The resulting clean dataset serves as the foundation for both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, enabling a detailed investigation into the factors that drive greenhouse gas emissions at the chemical and facility level within the electronics industry."

    "text": "The environmental repercussions of electronics manufacturing have become increasingly critical in the era of rapid technological advancement. This project presents a detailed, data-driven assessment of greenhouse gas emissions at the chemical level within the electronics manufacturing sector. Utilizing facility-reported data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we systematically analyzed emissions of individual fluorinated greenhouse gases (GHGs) across a range of chemicals, facilities, and years. By focusing on reported emissions in metric tons, the study identified the top-emitting chemical species and highlighted significant temporal and facility-level trends within the industry. Exploratory data analysis revealed a small number of chemicals contribute disproportionately to total emissions, while annual trends suggest variability linked to production cycles and facility operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Chemical Emissions by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Chemical Emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRMSE: 17.36499 \n\n\n\n\n\nActual vs Predicted Emissions"
